Code is adapted from Ian Cooper's finite differences method Matlab code. Simply open the .m file in Matlab and run the script.
Two graphs will appear; one plots the complete trajectory of the particle, and one plots the animated path of the particle's trajectory.

Parameters that can be adjusted to the user's preference are commented clearly in the script. 

Equations written in the script are derived in the submitted writeup.
